# Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol

This repository contains a suite of WordPress plugins designed for advanced pattern recognition, synchronization, and analysis. The system is built around a core engine called "BLOOM" and is extended by the "Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol" and managed through "APS Tools."

## Plugins

This project consists of three main plugins:

*   **`Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol`**: The core plugin for pattern synchronization and analysis. It orchestrates the communication and data flow between the BLOOM engine and the WordPress environment. It is responsible for syncing patterns, triggering analyses, and managing the overall workflow.

*   **`APS Tools`**: A comprehensive management interface for the entire system. It provides a user-friendly dashboard within the WordPress admin area to monitor system status, manage patterns, configure settings, and interact with the BLOOM engine.

*   **`BLOOM Pattern Recognition System`**: The heart of the pattern recognition capabilities. It is a powerful, multisite-aware engine that processes "tensor chunks" to identify and analyze patterns. It is designed to be a distributed system, capable of handling large-scale pattern recognition tasks across a network of sites.

## How They Work Together

The `BLOOM Pattern Recognition System` is the foundational engine that performs the heavy lifting of pattern analysis. The `Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol` acts as the middleware, connecting the BLOOM engine to the WordPress ecosystem and managing the synchronization of patterns and data. Finally, `APS Tools` provides the user interface for administrators to manage and monitor the entire system.

## Installation and Configuration

1.  **Prerequisites**: This plugin suite is designed for a WordPress Multisite environment.

2.  **Installation**:
    *   Clone this repository into your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
    *   Navigate to the Network Admin > Plugins page in your WordPress dashboard.
    *   Network Activate the following plugins in this order:
        1.  `BLOOM Pattern Recognition System`
        2.  `Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol`
        3.  `APS Tools`

3.  **Configuration**:
    *   After activation, a new menu item called "Pattern System" will appear in your WordPress admin sidebar.
    *   Navigate to "Pattern System" > "System Settings" to configure the plugins.
    *   The settings page for the `BLOOM Pattern Recognition System` can be found in the Network Admin under "BLOOM Patterns".

## Architecture

The system is designed with a layered architecture:

*   **Data Layer**: At the base is the `BLOOM Pattern Recognition System`, which manages the raw data for pattern recognition in the form of "tensor chunks." It is responsible for storing, processing, and analyzing this data.

*   **Logic Layer**: The `Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol` sits on top of the data layer. It implements the business logic of the system, including how patterns are synced, when analyses are triggered, and how the results are stored and managed.

*   **Presentation Layer**: The `APS Tools` plugin provides the user interface for the entire system. It allows administrators to interact with the logic layer, view the results of the data layer, and manage the system's settings.

## Key Features

*   **Distributed Pattern Recognition**: The `BLOOM` engine is designed to work in a distributed environment, making it suitable for large-scale pattern recognition tasks.
*   **Tensor Chunk Processing**: The system is optimized for processing "tensor chunks," which are the fundamental units of data for pattern analysis.
*   **Advanced Analysis**: The `Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol` provides advanced analysis capabilities, allowing for complex pattern comparisons and synchronization.
*   **Comprehensive Management Interface**: `APS Tools` offers a user-friendly interface for managing all aspects of the system, from system status to pattern analysis.
*   **WordPress Multisite Integration**: The entire suite is designed to integrate seamlessly with WordPress Multisite.

## Dependencies

This project has the following dependencies:

*   **WordPress**: This is a suite of WordPress plugins, so a WordPress installation is required.
*   **WordPress Multisite**: The `BLOOM Pattern Recognition System` is designed for a multisite environment.
*   **PHP**: The plugins require PHP 7.4 or higher.
