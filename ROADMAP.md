# Aevov Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Aevov Neurosymbolic Architecture. It is a living document that will be updated as the project evolves.

Our vision is to create a decentralized, distributed framework for advanced pattern recognition, as detailed in our [white paper](white-paper.md). This roadmap outlines the practical, incremental steps we will take to realize that vision, building on the foundational proof-of-concept in our public repository.

### Phase 1: Foundational Implementation (In Progress)

This phase focuses on building out the core functionality of the Aevov ecosystem within the existing WordPress-based architecture.

*   **Flesh out the BLOOM Engine:**
    *   **Task:** Implement the core tensor chunk processing logic within the `BLOOM\Processing\TensorProcessor` class.
    *   **Task:** Finalize the database schema for storing patterns, chunks, and their relationships.
    *   **Task:** Implement a robust API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting patterns and chunks.
*   **Implement the Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol (APS):**
    *   **Task:** Implement the `APS\Comparison\APS_Comparator` to perform meaningful comparisons between patterns.
    *   **Task:** Build out the `APS\Integration\BloomIntegration` to create a seamless connection between the APS and BLOOM plugins.
    *   **Task:** Develop a basic queueing system for processing analysis and comparison tasks.
*   **Enhance APS Tools:**
    *   **Task:** Improve the user interface for managing patterns and viewing analysis results.
    *   **Task:** Implement basic data visualizations for pattern comparisons.

### Phase 2: The Aevov Language (The "Lingua Franca")**

This phase focuses on the development of the Aevov Language, the purpose-built language that will be used to define patterns, rules, and ontologies.

*   **Develop the Aevov Language v1.0:**
    *   **Task:** Define the syntax and semantics of the language, starting with a simple, declarative syntax.
    *   **Task:** Create a parser and interpreter for the language.
    *   **Task:** Develop a standard library with a core set of functions for pattern matching and data manipulation.
*   **Integrate the Aevov Language with the BLOOM Engine:**
    *   **Task:** Allow patterns to be defined in the Aevov Language.
    *   **Task:** Use the Aevov Language to define the rules for the inference engine in the APS.

### Phase 3: Decentralization and the "Society of Minds"**

This phase focuses on the development of the decentralized components of the Aevov architecture, moving beyond the initial WordPress-based implementation.

*   **Develop the Decentralized BLOOM Engine:**
    *   **Task:** Implement the Kademlia-based Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for storing and retrieving tensor chunks.
    *   **Task:** Implement the consensus-driven pattern recognition algorithm.
*   **Develop the Decentralized Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol:**
    *   **Task:** Implement the distributed ledger for storing the knowledge graph.
    *   **Task:** Develop and test the "proof of contribution" consensus algorithm.
*   **Create a Standalone Version of the Aevov Platform:**
    *   **Task:** Develop a standalone, server-based version of the Aevov platform that is not dependent on WordPress.
    *   **Task:** Create a new, modern user interface for the standalone platform.

### Phase 4: Community and Ecosystem**

This phase focuses on building a strong and vibrant community around the Aevov project.

*   **Improve Developer Documentation:**
    *   **Task:** Create comprehensive documentation for the Aevov Language and the Aevov API.
    *   **Task:** Write tutorials and examples to help new developers get started with the platform.
*   **Foster a Contributor Community:**
    *   **Task:** Establish a clear process for contributing to the project.
    *   **Task:** Create a forum or chat channel for community discussions.
*   **Engage with the Broader AI Community:**
    *   **Task:** Present the Aevov architecture at academic conferences and industry events.
    *   **Task:** Publish papers and blog posts about the project.
