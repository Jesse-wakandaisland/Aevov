## Aevov Developer Documentation & Roadmap

### 1. Project Overview

This document provides a technical overview of the Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol, a suite of WordPress plugins for advanced, distributed pattern recognition. It is intended for developers who wish to contribute to the project or integrate with it.

**Project Completion:** We estimate the project to be approximately **70% complete**. The core architecture, plugin integration, and foundational UI are in place. The remaining work primarily involves refining the core algorithms, enhancing the user experience, and comprehensive testing.

### 2. Core Architecture

The system is comprised of three distinct but interconnected plugins:

*   **`BLOOM Pattern Recognition System` (The Engine):**
    *   **Purpose:** The foundational layer responsible for low-level pattern recognition. It processes "tensor chunks," which are the fundamental data units of the system.
    *   **Technology:** WordPress Multisite-aware, designed for distributed processing.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `BLOOM\Core\Bloom`: Main plugin class.
        *   `BLOOM\Models\*`: Data models for patterns, chunks, and tensors.
        *   `BLOOM\Processing\TensorProcessor`: Processes tensor chunks and extracts features and patterns.
        *   `BLOOM\Network\NetworkManager`: Manages communication between sites in the multisite network.

*   **`Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol` (The Conductor):**
    *   **Purpose:** The middleware that orchestrates the entire system. It manages the flow of data, triggers analyses, and ensures patterns are synced across the network.
    *   **Technology:** WordPress plugin that acts as a bridge between the UI and the BLOOM engine.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `APS\Analysis\APS_Plugin`: The main plugin class, which checks for BLOOM dependencies.
        *   `APS\Analysis\SymbolicPatternAnalyzer`: Analyzes and compares symbolic patterns.
        *   `APS\Comparison\APS_Comparator`: Intended to handle the comparison of different patterns, using the `SymbolicPatternAnalyzer` and `TensorProcessor`.
        *   `APS\Integration\BloomIntegration`: Manages the communication with the BLOOM plugin.

*   **`APS Tools` (The Cockpit):**
    *   **Purpose:** The user interface for the entire system. It provides a centralized dashboard for administrators to manage, monitor, and interact with the Aevov ecosystem.
    *   **Technology:** WordPress admin-facing plugin with REST API endpoints.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `APSTools\APSTools`: The main plugin class, responsible for creating admin menus and registering API endpoints.
        *   `APSTools\Handlers\*`: Handlers for various UI components and actions, such as table displays and pattern management.
        *   `APSTools\Templates\*`: PHP templates for the admin pages.
        *   `assets/js/*`: JavaScript files for the frontend of the admin interface.

### 3. Developer Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:** A WordPress Multisite installation with PHP 7.4+.
2.  **Installation:**
    *   Clone this repository into your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
    *   Activate the plugins in the following order from the Network Admin dashboard:
        1.  `BLOOM Pattern Recognition System`
        2.  `Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol`
        3.  `APS Tools`
3.  **Configuration:**
    *   The main dashboard is located under the "Pattern System" menu in the WordPress admin.
    *   BLOOM-specific settings are in the Network Admin under "BLOOM Patterns."

### 4. Roadmap

The following roadmap outlines the key areas for future development to bring the project to a production-ready state.

**Phase 1: Core Algorithm Implementation (In Progress)**

*   **Tensor Processor Refinement:**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Next Steps:** Refine and optimize the feature extraction and pattern detection algorithms in `BLOOM\Processing\TensorProcessor`.
*   **Pattern Comparison Engine:**
    *   **Status:** Implemented.
    *   **Next Steps:** Refine and optimize the comparison algorithms in `APS\Comparison\APS_Comparator` and `APS\Analysis\SymbolicPatternAnalyzer`.

**Phase 2: User Experience and Interface**

*   **Interactive Visualizations:**
    *   **Status:** Basic UI templates exist.
    *   **Next Steps:** Implement dynamic and interactive data visualizations for pattern analysis and system monitoring using a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) within the `APS Tools` plugin.
*   **Refine Management Workflows:**
    *   **Status:** Basic CRUD operations are possible.
    *   **Next Steps:** Improve the user workflows for managing patterns, models, and system settings to make them more intuitive.

**Phase 3: Testing and Hardening**

*   **Unit and Integration Testing:**
    *   **Status:** In progress.
    *   **Next Steps:** Resolve the issues with the testing environment and develop a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests for all three plugins. This is critical for ensuring the stability and reliability of the system.
*   **Performance and Scalability Testing:**
    *   **Status:** Not started.
    *   **Next Steps:** Conduct rigorous performance testing to identify and address bottlenecks, ensuring the system can handle large-scale data processing.
*   **Security Audit:**
    *   **Status:** Not started.
    *   **Next Steps:** Perform a thorough security audit to identify and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.

**Phase 4: The Proprietary Language**

*   **Integration with Aevov Language:**
    *   **Status:** Conceptual phase.
    *   **Next Steps:** Develop the proprietary Aevov programming language and integrate it with the BLOOM engine. This will be the primary monetization vehicle and will provide unparalleled capabilities for AI infrastructure development.

### 5. How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community. Please refer to the `README.md` for general contribution guidelines. For developers, we recommend starting with the "Phase 3: Testing and Hardening" tasks, as this is a critical area where the community can provide immediate value.

### 6. Known Issues

*   **Testing Environment:** The unit tests are not currently running due to issues with the testing environment. This is a high-priority issue that needs to be resolved.
