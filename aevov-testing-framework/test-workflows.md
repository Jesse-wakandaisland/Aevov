# Aevov Testing Workflows

## 1. Demo System Pattern Generation & Display Workflow

*   **Plugins Involved:** Aevov Demo System, BLOOM Pattern Recognition, APS Tools.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  A user interacts with the Aevov Demo System's frontend interface to initiate pattern generation (e.g., via a form submission or button click).
    2.  The Aevov Demo System triggers BLOOM to create a new pattern.
    3.  APS Tools processes and stores the generated pattern.
    4.  The Aevov Demo System retrieves and displays the newly generated pattern on its dashboard or a dedicated page.
*   **Test Focus:** Verifying end-to-end functionality of the demo system, data flow from demo to BLOOM/APS, and correct display of results.

## 2. Chunk Upload, Processing, and Diagnostic Workflow

*   **Plugins Involved:** APS Tools, BLOOM Pattern Recognition, Aevov Diagnostic Network.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  A user uploads a data chunk via APS Tools' interface (e.g., Directory Scanner or Chunk Import).
    2.  BLOOM processes the uploaded chunk to recognize patterns.
    3.  APS Tools manages the processed chunk and pattern data.
    4.  Aevov Diagnostic Network performs a health check, including verifying the integrity and availability of the newly processed chunk and pattern data.
*   **Test Focus:** Ensuring robust data ingestion, processing, and real-time diagnostic feedback.

## 3. Onboarding System Plugin Activation & Configuration Workflow

*   **Plugins Involved:** Aevov Onboarding System, APS Tools, BLOOM Pattern Recognition, Aevov Pattern Sync Protocol, Aevov Diagnostic Network.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  A user navigates through the Aevov Onboarding System.
    2.  The system guides the user to activate required plugins (APS Tools, BLOOM, APS Protocol, ADN).
    3.  The system then prompts for initial configuration settings for these plugins.
    4.  The Aevov Onboarding System verifies that all plugins are active and configurations are saved correctly.
*   **Test Focus:** Validating the onboarding process, ensuring plugins activate and integrate seamlessly, and that initial settings persist.
